# Identification of green jobs

Small explorative project to identify green jobs (the degree of a job's "greenness") in online job vacancies. Using a dictionary BIBB dictionary (https://github.com/johannabi/WAoeN/blob/main/data/WAoeN.csv), we search for all 1,800 keywords in the full texts of a random sample of ~360,000 job ads.
